Café-hopping to try all the Sachertorte I can get my hands on.

Densely packed with pastel and cream buildings, Vienna is a city that is both beautiful and elegant. The city is filled with museums, palaces, and churches, and is a great place to visit for those who enjoy history and architecture.

Saint Stephen's Cathedral is a beautiful church in the heart of Vienna. The church is free to enter, but there is a small fee to climb the tower. The tower is 137 meters tall, and the climb is 343 steps. The view from the top is worth the climb, and you can see the entire city of Vienna.

The church lends its name to the Stephansplatz, the surrounding square. The square is surrounded by shops and restaurants, and is a great place to spend an afternoon.

The Karlskirche is the most beautiful cathedral I've seen to date. With a light interior and a beautiful red marble, it is much less dreary that other Europe churches.

Schönbrunn Palace was the Habsburg's answer to Versailles and the other great palaces of the monarchs of Europe. The summer residence of the Emperor, it lies on the outskirts of the city.

The top of the hill behind the palace offers a great view of the city. The building is the gloriette, a pavilion in a raised area of an estate.

Hofburg Palace is the winter residence of the Emperor. The palace is now home to the Austrian President.

Just down the road is the Kunsthistorisches Museum, a museum of fine arts. The museum is home to a large collection of paintings, as well as a collection of natural history artifacts, and is a great place to spend a rainy afternoon.

Wiener Schnitzel is a traditional Austrian dish. It is a thin, breaded, pan-fried veal cutlet, and is served with a lemon wedge and potato salad. It's a simple dish, available all over the city.

The Vienna State Opera is famous for its performances of Mozart and Strauss, and amazing acoustics. It's consider one of the best, alongside the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam.

For dining, I recommend trying Hotel Sacher, Demel and Café Central, all of which contribute to Vienna's deserved reputation for coffee culture. Franz Sacher invented the [sachertorte,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachertorte) a chocolate cake with chocolate shell, for [Prince Klemens von Metternich,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klemens_von_Metternich) who orchestrated the "Concert of Europe" (i.e. peace settlement) in Europe following the degerat of Napoleon. Sacher later founded [Hotel Sacher.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel_Sacher) The brunch is fantastic, I got the soup, eggs benedict, and sachertorte.

[Demel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demel) is famous for suing Hotel Sacher over who was the true originator of Sachertorte, which they lost, however their Sachertorte is still delicious. [Café Central](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caf%C3%A9_Central) is famous for being the meeting place of many famous intellectuals, including Trotsky, Lenin, and Freud.
