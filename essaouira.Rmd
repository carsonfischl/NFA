Essaouira is a popular beach town with foreigners for good reason - the beaches are nice, the atmosphere is vibrant without being as overwhelming as Marrakesh, and there is good tourist infrastructure, with an airport and regular bus service. In 1969, Jimi Hendrix vacationed in the town, leading to many restaurants and hotels championing him and a connection to the hippie movement.
