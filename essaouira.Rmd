Essaouira is a popular beach town with foreigners for good reason - the beaches are nice, the atmosphere is vibrant without being as overwhelming as Marrakesh, and there is good tourist infrastructure, with an airport and regular bus service. In 1969, Jimi Hendrix vacationed in the town, leading to many restaurants and hotels championing him and a connection to the hippie movement.

Local fishermen pull a variety of creatures out of the ocean. Seafood is very common in the area, especially fried fish.

The city walls were designed and built by Europeans employed by the Sultan of Morocco during the 18th century. [ThÃ©odore Cornut,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th%C3%A9odore_Cornut) who also designed the fortifications of the town of Roussilon in France, did much of the design. The labour was mostly performed by captured Europeans from the 1765 failed [Larache Expedition.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larache_expedition)

Essaouira is known for its Thuya wood crafts, which are delicately worked by local artisans and have beautiful burl-like patterns.

Soccer games, camel and horse rides are popular on the beach. Going far enough down the coast, you can find the sand-covered ruins of the 18th century Dar Sultan Palace near the hamlet of Diabat.
