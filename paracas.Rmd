Paracas is a small town in the Pisco region, which gives its name to the national alcohol. It is a popular destination for tourists because of its proximity to the Paracas National Reserve and the Ballestas Islands.

The Red Beach is famous for its rugged appearance. It's not as sheer as pictures make it appear but is nonetheless very impressive.

I toured the park by ATV, which I recommend, but Peru Hop offers a bus tour that hits the same sights.

The city of Paracas is small and has a few restaurants and bars. Fishing is a common profession and the local ceviche is excellent.

The Ballestas Islands and the Candelabra petroglyph are a short boat ride from Paracas. The Islands are home to a variety of birds and sea lions.
