When I'm a retired Emperor, I might decide to grow cabbages here too.

Split is famous as the final residence of the Roman Emperor [Diocletian,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocletian) who was born in the nearby town of Solin, now a suburb of Split. The stunning tower of the [Cathedral of Saint Domnius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathedral_of_Saint_Domnius) now towers over the site. It's almost always crowded but still one of my favourite places for the historical significance and unique architecture.

Overall, Split is a great city to visit with a surprising amount of things to do. The boardwalk along the water is gorgeous and filled with young people and relaxing retirees.

Pršut is Istrian dry-cured ham. It's good, but not particularly unique. I ordered some on pizza to try but it would work best on a charcuterie board.

Gelateria Emiliana is in the center of town and is likely the best ice cream I've ever had. It's extremely popular with both tourists and locals and there is usually a line, especially in the evenings.

A little way down the coast is the fortress of a former Benedictine monastery, [Kaštilac,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ka%C5%A1tilac) which became a popular spot to check out after it was featured in the Game of Thrones television series.

In another suburb of Split can be found the ruins of [Solin,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solin) or ancient Salona, the birthplace of Roman Emperor Diocletian. It's usually pretty empty with just a few dogwalkers and is a great place to wander around if you are fascinated by ancient civilizations, giving one a place to daydream without large crowds.

The Split Archaeological Museum isn't particularly good but has interesting artifacts from the Avars, which was something I hadn't previously seen. You can see an impressive Roman sarcophagus here.
