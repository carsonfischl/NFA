“A master in the art of living draws no sharp distinction between her work and her play; her labor and her leisure; her mind and her body; her education and her recreation. She hardly knows which is which. She simply pursues her vision of excellence through whatever she is doing, and leaves others to determine if she is working or playing. To herself, she always appears to be doing both.”

- François-René de Chateaubriand

Rebuilt following extensive bombing during the Second World War, Saint-Malo, alongside Nice and Biarritz, has a reputation as one of France's premier vacation spots.

The [Cathédrale Saint-Vincent-de-Saragosse de Saint-Malo,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Malo_Cathedral) or Saint-Malo Cathedral, is a 12th century church that simultaneously blends into Saint-Malo's stone walls, yet towers above the city.

It is worth taking the time to walk the city walls, which can be done in a couple hours. Mostly reconstructed in the 20th century, they are still extremely impressive and make one want to embark on a seafaring adventure.

In the south of town is [Tour Solidor,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidor_Tower) a 13th century defensive structure built by the Duke of Brittany to control access to the bay, as Saint-Malo, was resisting his authority at the time. It's a popular kayaking spot next to the neighbourhood of Saint-Servan today. There is also camping in the nearby park during most of the year.

Crêpes are globally known to be French, but are specifically from Brittany. These were from a different restaurant, however I recommend Hôtel Chateaubriand for breakfast.
