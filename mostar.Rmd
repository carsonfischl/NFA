Be sure to jump off the bridge (I didn't).

The town's iconic bridge was built in the 16th century, but was destroyed in 1993 during the Balkan Wars. It has since been rebuilt and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Divers wait on the bridge - it's 23 meter drop. You can jump yourself if you talk to the diving school next to the bridge, get some lessons, do practice jumps, and pay a fee.

The town's mosque is also quite nice.
