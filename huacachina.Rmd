Meaning "hidden lagoon" in the indigenous Quecha language, Huacachina is a desert oasis adjacent to the city of Ica. The lagoon is surrounded by palm trees and sand dunes, and is a popular spot for sandboarding and dune buggy rides. The town is small and can be walked in about 10 minutes. There are a few restaurants and hostels, and the town is a popular spot for backpackers. The Wild Rover and Kokopelli hostels are highly recommended for your stays around Peru, but the Wild Rover in Huacachina was particularly welcoming.

The oasis proper is small, but the surrounding sand dunes are vast and beautiful. The town has a permanent population of around 100 people, but the population swells with tourists.

The major city of Ica is nearby and surrounds the dunes on two sides. It is well-known for its pisco breweries.

I stayed at the Wild Rover hostel and had one of my best stays in all my travels. The hostel is a party hostel, but the staff are friendly and the food is good. The hostel has a pool and a bar, and the staff hold karaoke nights and other events. The hostel is a great place to meet other travelers.

Sandboarding and dune buggy rides are popular and cheap, the best way to see the dunes.
