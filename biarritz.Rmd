Biarritz & Bayonne are sister towns in the French Basque country that can be hit on the same day trip. Biarritz was a favorite vacation spot of Empress Eugenie, wife of Napoleon III, for good reason - it's a gorgeous seaside town, known for surfing and tanning on the beach.

Basque cake ("Etxeko bixkotxa," or "cake of the house" in Basque) is a local specialty, a mix between a cake and a cookie. Quality seems to vary a lot but it is definitely worth trying.
