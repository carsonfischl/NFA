Pisac is another popular site to visit in the Sacred Valley and worth the trip. It offers stellar views of the surrounding valley and shows off the Inca's terraced agriculure. The site is also a great place to see the Inca's advanced stonework. The site is a short drive from Cusco and can be combined with a trip to Ollantaytambo.
