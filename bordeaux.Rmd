Porte Cailhau is a gate in the old city walls that was the home of King Charles VIII of France after the French took the city. The local population was still fiercely independent and the king was not safe in the city, and thus took refuge in the imposing structure. The remains of the city walls can be seen protruding from the structure, as well as slit-type windows for archers to fire their arrows.

Place de la Bourse was the former site of the stock exchange (a "bourse" in French). In the early 2000s, the city of Bordeaux decided to replace the parking lot in front of the building with a large reflecting pool, known as the Miroir d'Eau, inspired by Saint Mark's Square in Venice. Today, the reflecting pool is one of the largest in the world and is a popular hangout spot for locals and tourists. The fountain is the center of the square, The Three Graces, is by Italian sculptor Visconti.

Palais Gallien is the remains of the Roman amphitheater of Burdigala, the former name of the Roman settlement that would become Bordeaux. As the name suggests, the amphitheater was built during the reign of Emperor Gallienus during the second century, who would ironically see the secession of the Gallic provinces from the empire.
