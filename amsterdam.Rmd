Snaked with canals, Amsterdam is well-known for its cycling culture and an open-minded approach to living (at least to outsiders).

```{r echo = FALSE, results = 'asis'}
titles <- c("Length of Stay", "Transportation", "Major Sights","Unique Foods", "Restaurant Recommendations")
values <- c("One day", "3 hour drive from Mouscron", "Rijksmuseum, Van Gogh Museum", "Stroopwaffle, Bitterballen", "")
df <- data.frame(titles, values)
library(knitr)
kable(df, col.names = NULL)
```

The city is famous for its canals, especially the Keizersgracht, Prinsengracht, Singel and Herengracht canals, which ring the city center.

Bitterballen are fried balls of meat and are a popular snack in the Netherlands.

I went in May, so tulips were in full bloom. It's better to leave the city to see them but they can still be found in planters around town.

The beautiful homes around town are reminiscent of the Dutch Golden Age.
