Meteora is a mountainous region in central Greece, famous for its medieval monasteries perched on top of towering rock pillars. The six monasteries still operating today are built on immense natural pillars and hill-like rounded boulders that dominate the local area. It is located near the town of Kalabaka. The Meteora is included on the UNESCO World Heritage List.
