A great place to force the abdication of a rival monarch.

I passed through this gorgeous town to catch the train on the way back from [Biarritz](./biarritz.html). The city is famous as the location of the ["Abdications of Bayonne,"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdications_of_Bayonne) where Napoleon took advantage of Spanish political upheaval. Upset at mismanagement of the government of King Charles IV, supporters of his son Ferdinand VII organized a palace coup. Napoleon "settled" the succession dispute by summoning both monarchs to a French Imperial residence in Bordeaux, the Castle of Marracq, where he forced the abdication of both monarchs, who would remain in French custody until late 1813.
