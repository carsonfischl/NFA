La Rochelle is a coastal city that is famous for being a Prostestant stronghold during the [French Wars of Religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Wars_of_Religion) from 1562 to 1589, when the city was besieged by Catholic forces led by Cardinal Richelieu. The city's walls were demolished, but three of the large towers remain.

The pointed tower is Tour de la Lanterne (the "Lantern Tower"), which served as a lighthouse and prison.

Carvings from prisoners cover the inner walls of Tour de la Lanterne. Some of the most famous prisoners of the tower were [the four sergeants](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quatre_sergents_de_La_Rochelle) - in 1822, four Bonapartiste NCOs, accused of plotting to overthrow the restored Bourbon monarchy, were held in the tower prior to their execution in Paris in front of the Hôtel de Ville.

The Saint-Nicholas Tower was completed in 1376 and serves, along with Tour de La Chaîne, as a guard tower for La Rochelle's harbour. Each tower would hold a Captain, along with a company of soldiers and possibly prisoners in the center cells. The towers would string a chain across the mouth of the harbour to close off the port in the event of an attack.

Tour de la Chaîne is the smaller, partner tower to Saint-Nicholas. On the occasion of my visit, it was flying the South African flag as a sign of respect for South Africa, who was playing France in the Rugby World Cup. The French have mastered the art of both self-aggrandizement, as well as the line between flattery and respect of other cultures - it is common to see monuments and streets named after foreign artists and leaders across France.

The beautiful boardwalk extends all the way down the coast to Île de Ré.
