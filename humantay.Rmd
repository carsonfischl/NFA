An Instagrammable mountain oasis.

Laguna Humantay is a beautiful turquoise lake at the base of a glacier. It is a 2 hour hike from the trailhead and part of the legendary Salkantay trek to Machu Picchu. Definitely one of the more challenging hikes I've done, but the view is worth it.

```{r echo = FALSE, results = 'asis'}
titles <- c("Length of Stay", "Transportation", "Major Sights","Unique Foods", "Restaurant Recommendations")
values <- c("Two hours", "2 hour hike after 1 hour drive from Cusco", "The lake", "", "")
df <- data.frame(titles, values)
library(knitr)
kable(df, col.names = NULL)
```
