[Saint-Émilion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-%C3%89milion) is a hamlet not far from Bordeaux. Famous for Saint-Émilion Grand Crus, some of the best wines in the world, as well as the Sémilion white grape cultivar, the area has a rich history of viticulture and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

The Monolithic Church of Saint-Émilion dominates the city and is very impressive. The ice cream shop next door is good.
