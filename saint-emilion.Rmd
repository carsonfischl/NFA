La Havre and the town on the opposite side of the river, Honfleur, sit at the mouth of the Seine and were major ports during the Hundred Years War and the Viking invasions. Normandy is a major artistic center since the Impressionist movement and the local galleries have works from many famous painters. I missed the local cliffs at Êtretat but I'm assured they're worth visiting.
