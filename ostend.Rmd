One of the largest city on the Belgian coast, Ostend was a major port in the Middle Ages, but has since been eclipsed by larger cities like Antwerp.

The boulevard along the shore is a perfect place for a stroll, especially in the evenings, and is decorated with large sculptures and other public art.

[Fort Napoléon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Napoleon,_Ostend) is, as the name suggests, a pentagonal Napoléonic fort on the outskirts of town, along the sea. Having occupied the low countries during the early revolutionary wars, French leadership anticipated a British amphibious invasion like the one that happened at Quiberon Bay, and so constructed the fort in 1811. As the French retreated following Napoléon's failed Russian expedition, the French occupation was terminated in 1814 and the fort abandoned. The beach is a known windurfing destination today and the fort can be toured, along there isn't a ton to see.

Filer Américain is a raw beef and mayonnaise spread that is popular on sandwiches in the Belgium and northern France. I got a sandwich of it at Charcuterie Mazure in Ostend, which was outstanding with lettuce and tomato.

While not that old compared to many other religious buildings in Belgium, the [Saint Peter and Paul Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sint-Petrus-en-Pauluskerk) (Sint-Petrus-en-Pauluskerk) was built in 1908 by King Leopold II and is very ornate.
