Ouarzazate is an ancient Berber city in the Atlas Mountains, famous for its old [kasbah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kasbah_Taourirt) and the nearby ksar of [Aït Benhaddou,](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/444/) a fortified city along the ancient caravan route between the Sahara and Marrakesh, which is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It was also the filming location for many notable films, including the aforementioned Lawrence of Arabia, The Mummy, and some Game of Thrones episodes.

My AirBnB was on the outskirts of town, but well-decorated in a Berber style.

I enjoyed this great msemmen with mint tea while waiting for the bus to Merzouga. They are sweet, crunchy semolina pancakes that are fried of a griddle and rolled with some sort of filling, usually honey and creamy cheese like La Vache Qui Rit, Nutella, or sometimes jam.

[Kasbah Taourirt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kasbah_Taourirt) is an old fortified settlement in the center of Ouarzazate. Built over 300 years ago by a powerful local family, it's surrounded by souks and cafés and is definitely worth spending a day to tour, although parts were closed for renovation when I went (December 2023).
