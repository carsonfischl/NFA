Watch out for the tree snakes.

One of the most hydrologically interesting places in the world, Plitvice Lakes National Park comprises an extensive lake system, contained by porous rock barriers. The travertine pools cascade into one another, leading to impressive series of waterfalls. This place was definitely a highlight of my Croatia trip. 

```{r echo = FALSE, results = 'asis'}
titles <- c("Length of Stay", "Transportation", "Major Sights","Unique Foods", "Restaurant Recommendations")
values <- c("One day", "5 hour drive from Split", "Upper lakes, lower lakes", "N/A", "N/A")
df <- data.frame(titles, values)
library(knitr)
kable(df, col.names = NULL)
```

The park is also a breeding ground for the [common European adder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vipera_berus) and [horned viper,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vipera_ammodytes) in addition to numerous other species of reptile and the Eurasian lynx. These vipers are ovoviviparous (the eggs hatch inside the mother) and gives birth to live young. Mothers are known to climb into trees to avoid being bitten by their own young.

The largest falls in the park, near the lower lake system. Notice how small the line of tourists appears to be, near the base of the falls.
