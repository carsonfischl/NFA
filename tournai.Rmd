Once capital of the Frankish Empire, the famous Frankish ruler Childeric's tomb was found near Tournai in 1693. Despite being in Belgium today, the bejeweled items in the tomb would [inspire French Imperial and Royal imagery](https://www.hhantiquejewelry.com/napoleon-bees-jewelry-tomb-childeric-i-symbols-empire/) for centuries afterwards.

As with many Belgian and northern French towns, the city skyline is dominated by a beffroi, or belfry.

Tournai's beffroi is at one end of the Grand-Place, the triangular main square.

Galette des Rois, a French/Belgian New Year's tradition - a bean is hidden in the cake and is found by the king, who is given a paper "crown."
