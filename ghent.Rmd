Straight out of a medieval fantasy.

One of Belgium's most popular tourist destinations alongside Bruges and Antwerp, Ghent was my favourite destination in Belgium. The city is densely packed with dramatic towers and Gothic architecture. As seen on the map, the city has a wide network of canals and bridges that add to its romantic allure.

The Gravensteen is a 12th century castle that served as the residence of the Counts of Flanders for several centuries. After the Counts moved their court to the Prisenhof (also in Ghent but no longer standing), the building was repurposed several times, including becoming a factory, before being restored in the early 20th century. It is open for tours today.

View of the city center from Saint Michael's bridge. This is a great photo spot and popular with tourists since it gives a clear view of Saint Nicholas' Church (Sint-Niklaaskerk) and, depending on the angle, the Belfry of Ghent (Belfort van Gent).

The Frites Atelier in the city center has some of the best fries I've ever had, in a country full of great French fries.

On the other side is Saint Bavo's Cathedral, the seat of the Bishopric of Ghent.
