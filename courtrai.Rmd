Courtrai, or Kortrijk in Dutch, is one of the first Dutch speaking towns in the Belgian countryside, as the language and culture shifts from French (Wallonia) to Dutch (Flanders). The change is quite abrupt, and many people in town don't speak French at all.

The [Broel Towers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broeltowers) are the remains of the medieval city walls and control access to the Lys River. Cycling down the paths along the river makes for an enjoyable afternoon. The waterway is full of cute [common moorhens,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_moorhen) known as a "poule d'eau" in French, which translates to "water chicken."

The town hall is across from the belfry and is a popular hangout spot for locals.

Saint Martin's Church (Sint-Maartenskerk) is perhaps the nicest building in town and worth visiting if in town.
