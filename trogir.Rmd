The last stop on Split's public bus service, [Trogir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trogir) is a hamlet of the city and well-worth a day trip for its gorgeous Venetian architecture. The city was founded by Greek colonists as Tragurion in the 3rd century BC and has been inhabited ever since.

The boardwalk along the ocean is a great place for an evening stroll back from Kamerlengo Castle.

[Kamerlengo Castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamerlengo_Castle) dates to the 15th century. It's essentially empty but provides a nice view of the harbour if you climb the ramparts.

The [Cathedral of Saint Lawrence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trogir_Cathedral) is a major landmark of the city. The front entrance is beautifully decorated by master Croat sculptor Radovan, a resident of Trogir.

Radovan's magnificent sculpting work.

Pašticada is a traditional Croat wedding stew, usually served with gnocchi, that I enjoyed in Trogir. It's extremely tasty, although not unlike the beef stews that many Anglophones will be familiar with.
