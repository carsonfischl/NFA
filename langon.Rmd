A brief castle stop in the heart of wine country.

My visit to Langon was accidental, thanks to a train delay. Nevertheless, it was refreshing to see the town and the gorgeous Château de Roquetaillade. The surrounding landscape is full of picturesque vineyards.

Château de Roquetaillade is near the hamlet of Mazères and quite impressive. According to legend, the first castle on the site was built by Charlemagne and made of wood. The current castle was built in 1306 by [Cardinal de la Motte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaillard_de_la_Mothe) with permission from English King Edward I, who ruled Gascony at the time. It remains privately owned but open for tours. Pictures of the interior weren't allowed, however it was restored in the 19th century by famous French architect [Eugène Viollet-le-Duc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eug%C3%A8ne_Viollet-le-Duc), who also restored Carcassonne and Pierrefonds.
